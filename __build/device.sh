# This script should define device-based properties

DEVICE_CODENAME="oneplus2" # This is AOSP variant to build, the one used in brunch command. If you use "brunch i9300", you should set it to i9300
DEVICE_BUILDVARIANT="userdebug" # "user" is best, but requires extra fixes, so "userdebug" is default

# Apart from above, don't forget to:
# 1. Copy permission and symlinks to updater-script after first build
# 2. Copy appropriate overlay from "_devices" directory
# 3. Set device properties also in aroma-config
# 4. Put proper GAPPS using gapps.sh
# 5. I most likely forgot about something anyway, will update as needed
