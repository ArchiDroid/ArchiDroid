# DON'T REMOVE THIS FILE
# ArchiDroid's Init.d contains two parts - a /system/bin/debuggerd hook and this init.d script
# This file has a very simple purpose of telling debuggerd hook that init.d has been executed already
#
# Debuggerd hook always waits for kernel and other init.d callers, and if nobody cares then it executes all init.d scripts
# Therefore, it's a very safe method for having reliable init.d call, without modyfing the kernel's ramdisk

# Don't change values below unless you know what you're doing
CHECKPART="/data/local/tmp/ARCHIDROID_INITD" # This is the check-file, must be the same here and in the hook part described above

# Core
