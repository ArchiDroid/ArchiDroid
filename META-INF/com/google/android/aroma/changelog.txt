ArchiDroid 3.0.1.1

* i9300-specific:
- Updated ArchiKernel to V1.7.2 # This should be fix sleep of death issue

ArchiDroid 3.0.1

- ArchiDroid APK: Updated to 1.2
* Improved various comparisions between remote and current variables, mostly version, build date and version type
* Added foreground service to update function in order to prevent Android from closing APK unless it will be absolutely necessary
* Added background service, which checks for new versions for both experimental and stable branches periodically
# Check is done once per 24 hours to minimize battery consumption, there are no hidden wakelocks. In future, this option may be customizable
# Only currently installed branch will be checked, which means that stable users will get stable updates and expermental users will get experimental updates
# Of course you can change the branch anytime you want by downloading & flashing particular one through the APK
# The amount of network data required for making one check is equal to the size of remote build.prop, around 4 kilobytes
# Check includes comparision of two variables - version, and build date (the latter one is mostly for experimental users, as it's rolling branch)
# If there's no network during the check time, it's not being called at all (skipped until next one)
# If there's new version available, a dismissible notification with proper information is shown
# At the moment this feature is NOT optional, as I see no reason for making it so.
# You're not forced to update, but ArchiDroid will keep reminding you about new version every day (if the internet will be available at check time of course)

- Adblock: Fixes DNSMonitor being active when adblock was disabled

- Adblock: Updated AdAway and MoAB hosts
- AROMA: Various language updates, thanks to appropriate translators

* i9300-specific:
- Updated ArchiKernel to V1.7
- Updated Boeffla Kernel to 2.4 (NG)
- Stock crappy smdk4x12 kernel has been dropped completely
# ArchiDroid now uses ArchiKernel sources for stock kernel
# This change was required for HWC and other fixes below
# Stock kernel DOES NOT have AK goodies in order to provide stable experience
# It doesn't include optimizations, OC, STweaks, Boeffla sound or any other special feature found in AK
# However, it DOES include everything required for stock and stable experience, such as i9300 Update14 Sammy sources
# Full ArchiKernel is still available and recommended for full synergy with ArchiDroid, stock kernel "just works"

- Disorted audio during video recording should be fixed
- Tweaked other audio-related variables for better quality and less stuttering, especially A2DP
- Misc RIL fixes

[!] The original author for all below changes is Dhiru from Nameless ROM. I backported these fixes/improvements from NamelessROM Lollipop back to ArchiDroid KitKat
- HWComposer is now fully fixed and working
# You can check that it's not placebo in developers options, under "Show GPU view updates" option -> Flash views inside windows when drawn with the GPU
# In pre-3.0.1, nothing is flashing when you're navigating through windows, in 3.0.1, the whole screen should start blinking red, this indicates that windows are rendered by GPU
# HWComposer should minimize battery usage spent on drawing, improve 2D graphics, and make UI smooth as silk
# NOTICE: ArchiDroid still uses R3P2, R4P0 was unstable, slow and buggy, even NamelessROM dropped that, also R4P0 wasn't compatible with new HWC
- Camera is now fully fixed and working
# ArchiDroid now uses open-source camera (like OMNI) instead of camera blob wrapper found in CM
- Gralloc fixes and improvements
# Decoding/Encoding video should be much more stable now, this includes e.g. camera and youtube
# Additionally, ArchiDroid now uses open-source libUMP (Universal Memory Provider)
- Other misc NamelessROM improvements and fixes for i9300 from Lollipop
