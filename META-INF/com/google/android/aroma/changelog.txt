ArchiDroid 3.0.1

- ArchiDroid APK: Updated to 1.2
* Improved various comparisions between remote and current variables, mostly version, build date and version type
* Added foreground service to update function in order to prevent Android from closing APK unless it will be absolutely necessary
* Added background service, which checks for new versions for both experimental and stable branches periodically
# Check is done once per 24 hours to minimize battery consumption, there are no hidden wakelocks. In future, this option may be customizable
# Only currently installed branch will be checked, which means that stable users will get stable updates and expermental users will get experimental updates
# Of course you can change the branch anytime you want by downloading & flashing particular one through the APK
# The amount of network data required for making one check is equal to the size of remote build.prop, around 4 kilobytes
# Check includes comparision of two variables - version, and build date (the latter one is mostly for experimental users, as it's rolling branch)
# If there's no network during the check time, it's not being called at all (skipped until next one)
# If there's new version available, a dismissible notification with proper information is shown
# At the moment this feature is NOT optional, as I see no reason for making it so.
# You're not forced to update, but ArchiDroid will keep reminding you about new version every day (if the internet will be available at check time of course)
